### The Challenge

Your challenge was to build out this recipe page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS preprocessor

### What I Learned

In this project, I learned how to create a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes by adopting a mobile-first approach. 

### Continued Development

In future projects, I want to focus more on:
